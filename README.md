# Virtual-Study-Buddy
Excel in your studies with a complete virtual education assistant

## Inspiration
The increasing shift toward digital education and the growing need for accessible and flexible learning inspired us to build this project. While virtual learning gained prominence during the pandemic, it continues to evolve as a powerful tool for students worldwide. My goal is to create a socially impactful solution that enhances online learning, making it more engaging, interactive, and inclusiveâ€”especially for students with diverse learning needs. By leveraging technology, we aim to bridge gaps in education, offering students a more effective and personalized learning experience.

## What it does
Virtual Study Buddy is a website that ensures that online classes are easy and effective for students. Virtual Study Buddy not only helps students learn virtually but also helps teachers to teach better, as well as improve the learning for individuals who have certain disabilities. 

The feature of AR helps the children to connect more to the subject concepts by allowing learners to interact with the visual representation of the aspect being taught, which increases the engagement level of students as well as provides them a hands-on implementation approach virtually.

The Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text feature of the website is specially dedicated to making the lives of students easier, including those individuals with learning disabilities. As the name suggests, the Text-to-Speech feature allows students to hear the text notes/material in an audio form. The Text-to-Speech feature is incorporated keeping in mind the individuals with certain disabilities, for example, visually impaired individuals, learners with dyslexia, teachers with speaking disabilities, etc.
The Speech-to-Text Learning feature aims to help children who have writing disabilities. Using this feature, children will be able to speak and the computer will write whatever they say down for them. This can also help in taking notes.

There is also another special feature of emotion detection, that allows teachers to detect and realize the mood of the students, so they can monitor the focus and engagement level of class and teach according to it. 

## How we built it
First, I designed a prototype in **figma**. Then we made using replit as it gives the results in real-time. We have used CSS, HTML and JS and we also included machine learning
